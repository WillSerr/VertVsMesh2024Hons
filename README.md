William Serrels #2001952 Computer Games Application Development BsC(Hons), Dissertation Artefact submission 2024.


This submission contains the executables for rendering using either the standard shader model or the newer mesh shader pipeline.

In order to render a model, it's path will need added as a command line argument. For example to use the provided sphere model use 'start ModelViewer.exe -model models/DiscoBall.glb'.
I could set up a Batch file to do this but it would most likely cause more problem than it solves due to firewalls e.t.c.

The program is designed to work with GLTF files so other file types may not work.

Pressing P will write the recorded render times for the past few frames in a text file.
